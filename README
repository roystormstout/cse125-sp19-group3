Setting up the Visual Studio Environment at home: 

* The lab machines use Visual Studio 2017. If you have a different version of VS you'll need to install a few things. 
* All of the following can be installed using the Visual Studio Installer (it will modify the existing copy of VS).

1.) Windows SDK: 10.0.16299 

2.) Platform toolset: Visual Studio 2017 build tools v=141 

3.) Once installed you can right click the project -> properties -> General. Make sure SDK & platform toolset are correct.
