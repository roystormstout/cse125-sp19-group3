# Setting up the Visual Studio Environment (non-2017): 

* Be sure to also follow the setup for setting up VS for the first time.

* The lab machines use Visual Studio 2017. If you have a different version of VS you'll need to install a few things. 
* All of the following can be installed using the Visual Studio Installer (it will modify the existing copy of VS).

1.) Windows SDK: 10.0.16299 

2.) Platform toolset: Visual Studio 2017 build tools v=141 

3.) Once installed you can right click the project -> properties -> General. Make sure SDK & platform toolset are correct.


# Sending Requests to Server without running the client: 

* You can test the server connection without running the client by using the *nux 'nc' command. After running the server input 'nc <host> <port>' into the terminal to make a request to the server. 

* An alternative would be to use 'curl -v <host>:<port>' 
  --> '-v' for verbose mode, shows the GET request and how the server handles it.
